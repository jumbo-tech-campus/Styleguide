# Jumbo Style Guide

Every project should have its own style guide.


Every member of the team in Jumbo has a different background: different mindset, different experiences and it means that everyone has a different coding style.

This repository will contain all the style guides written within Jumbo: *Style* covers a lot of topic, from the _cameCase_ use to the file naming convention. We will continue to improve it and change it based on the language evolution.

Current list of guide lines:
