# Unit test guidelines

Writing unit tests can be done in many ways, but all of them have some default rules to adhere to. Further more we recommend using [Quick](https://github.com/Quick/Quick) & [Nimble](https://github.com/Quick/Nimble) for unit tests in Swift, with writing mocks as described below.

## General guidelines

- Never use a shared instance of a class in any part of a unit test, i.e.
```swift
UserDefaults.standard
UIApplication.shared
```
- Never use any form of waiting directly in the tests
```swift
sleep()
NSRunLoop.current
while (value != expected) { }
```

To wait for code to finish use `XCTestExpectation` when writing a `XCTest` or `expectEventually` when writing a spec using `Quick & Nimble`

## Quick & Nimble guidelines

Quick & Nimble provide 5 important DSL keywords, below follow which should be used in different scenarios.
Each of these keywords takes a string, which is a description of the block to follow.
All of these describing strings will be used by the framework to generate the test function, i.e
```
describe("MyClass") {
    describe("execute the function") {
        it("sets the variable") {
        }
    }
}
```
Would become `MyClass__executing_the_function__sets_the_variable`. 

These test functions read in one go
 - Which object is being tested
 - Which functionality is being tested
 - What is expected

To make sure these test functions all read in a similar fassion Always use **present tense** for DSL keyword descriptions.
You can check this by replacing the first `describe` keyword with 'when':

`when` MyClass execute the function it sets the variable


### Describe

Use `describe` when **starting a spec function**. This is also the place where the `sut` is defined:
```swift
class BoolSpec: QuickSpec {
    override func spec() {
        describe("Bool") {
            var sut: Bool!

            ...
        }
    }
}

```

The other use of describe is to describe **a piece functionality within the class** under test. 

**Rule of thumb**: When adding a `beforeEach` statement in a `describe` it should only prepare for `context` calls to follow. Don't execute any code on the class under test. 

For example a `negate()` function within a `Bool` class;

```swift
class BoolSpec: QuickSpec {
    override func spec() {
        describe("Bool") {
            var sut: Bool!

            context("with a false value") {
                beforeEach {
                    sut = false

                    ...
                }

                afterEach {
                    ...

                    sut = nil
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```

### Context

Use `context` to define the different flows of the a certain functionality within the `describe` closure, for example:

```swift
class BoolSpec: QuickSpec {
    override func spec() {
        describe("Bool") {
            var sut: Bool!

            describe("negating the value") {
                context("negating a true value") {
                    ...
                }

                context("negating a false value") {
                    ...
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```

### BeforeEach

`beforeEach` should only be used within `describe` or `context` closures. Use beforeEach for;
1. Preparing mocks & test input data
2. Creating or modifying the `sut`
3. Execute the code under test (as defined in the `describe` closure)

```swift
class BoolSpec: QuickSpec {
    override func spec() {
        describe("Bool") {
            var sut: Bool!

            describe("negating the value") {
                context("negating a true value") {
                    beforeEach {
                        sut = true
                        sut.negate()
                    }
                }

                context("negating a false value") {
                    beforeEach {
                        sut = false
                        sut.negate()
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```

### It

`it` is where assertions are executed in the form of an `expect()` call.

**Rule of thumb**: Only execute one `expect` call per `it` closure

```swift
class BoolSpec: QuickSpec {
    override func spec() {
        describe("Bool") {
            var sut: Bool!

            describe("negating the value") {
                context("negating a true value") {
                    beforeEach {
                        sut = true
                        sut.negate()
                    }

                    it("sets the value to false") {
                        expect(sut) == false
                    }
                }

                context("negating a false value") {
                    beforeEach {
                        sut = false
                        sut.negate()
                    }

                    it("sets the value to true") {
                        expect(sut) == true
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```

### AfterEach

`afterEach` should only be used within `describe` or `context` closures. Use afterEach for;
1. Nullify all variables instantiated in the current `describe` / `context`
2. Any other cleanup your test specifically need

**Note**: Setting all variables to `nil` technically isn't necessary, but it's a small effort to add them and have certainty all values are reset correctly.


```swift
class BoolSpec: QuickSpec {
    override func spec() {
        describe("Bool") {
            var sut: Bool!

            afterEach {
                sut = nil
            }

            describe("negating the value") {
                context("negating a true value") {
                    beforeEach {
                        sut = true
                        sut.negate()
                    }

                    it("sets the value to false") {
                        expect(sut) == false
                    }
                }

                context("negating a false value") {
                    beforeEach {
                        sut = false
                        sut.negate()
                    }

                    it("sets the value to true") {
                        expect(sut) == true
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```

## Writing Swift mocks

### Terminology

When it comes to writing mocks in Swift theres a great many ways developers do this, but we can never agree upon the naming.

Imagine a protocol `MyProtocol`, some would create `MyProtocolMock` where others use `MyProtocolStub`. Which of them is correct? Neither, see below.

#### Mock

Mocks are objects that register calls they receive.
In test assertion we can verify on Mocks that all expected actions were performed.

#### Stub

Stub is an object that holds predefined data and uses it to answer calls during tests. It is used when we cannot or donâ€™t want to involve objects that would answer with real data or have undesirable side effects.
![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*KdpZaEVy6GNnrUpB.png)

#### Fake

Fakes are objects that have working implementations, but not same as production one. Usually they take some shortcut and have simplified version of production code.

### Example mock from protocol

As you can read, neither `...Stub` nor `...Mock` would cover the full load of a object we want to write. Our test-objects should be able to mimic a protocol by both setting stubs and registering received method calls. We don't want multiple files for a single Protocol in order to both mock & stub them, thus we want one object which can both stub and mock a protocol.

The `...Double` suffix is coined as wel for this goal, derived from body-double, but this term on it's own only adds confusion. In the end calling your 'minimal' implementation of a class a `Mock` feels most natural, where a mock is build up from two parts;
 - Captures: Basically the Mocks as described above. They register the captured method calls
 - Stubs: Stubs as described above

This way we have one object to wrap a full protocol in, having both mocking and stubbing capabilities.

```swift
protocol ExampleProtocol {
    var testVar: String { get }

    func doFunction(var: String)
    func returnFunction(number: Int, otherNumber: Int) -> String
}
```

```swift
class ExampleProtocolMock {
    var Stubs {
        var testVar = String()
        var returnFunction: String()
    }

    var Captures {
        var doFunction: DoFunction
        var returnFunction: ReturnFunction

        struct DoFunction {
            let var: String
        }

        struct ReturnFunction {
            let number: Int
            let otherNumber: Int
        }
    }

    var stubs = Stubs()
    var captures = Captures()
}

extension ExampleProtocolDouble: ExampleProtocol {
    var testVar: String { 
        return stubs.testVar
    }

    func doFunction(var: String) {
        captures.doFunction = Captures.DoFunction(var: var)
    }

    func returnFunction(number: Int, otherNumber: Int) -> String {
        captures.returnFunction = Captures.ReturnFunction(number: number, otherNumber: otherNumber)

        return stubs.returnFunction
    }
}

```
